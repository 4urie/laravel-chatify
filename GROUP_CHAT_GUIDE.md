## Testing
1. Register/login with multiple users

3. Send messages in the group
4. Test file sharing functionality
5. Try translation features with different languages
6. Test admin functions (add/remove members, edit group)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Groups not loading**: Check if migrations ran successfully
2. **Files not uploading**: Ensure `storage/app/public` is writable
3. **Translation not working**: Verify TranslationService configuration
4. **Real-time not working**: Check JavaScript console for errors

### Debug Commands
```bash
php artisan migrate:status    # Check migration status
php artisan storage:link      # Link storage directory
php artisan route:list        # List all routes
php artisan tinker           # Test models in console
```

## Future Enhancements
